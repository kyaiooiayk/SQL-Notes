Example 1:

Input: 
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output: 
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+

## SQL schema
```
Create table If Not Exists Weather (id int, recordDate date, temperature int)
Truncate table Weather
insert into Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) values ('1', '2015-01-01', '10')
insert into Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) values ('2', '2015-01-02', '25')
insert into Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) values ('3', '2015-01-03', '20')
insert into Weather (id, recordDate, temperature) values ('4', '2015-01-04', '30')
```

## SQL type
- MySQL

## Solution #1
```
SELECT W1.id 
FROM Weather W1
INNER JOIN Weather W2
ON TO_DAYS(W1.recordDate) = TO_DAYS(W2.recordDate) + 1
WHERE W1.Temperature > W2.Temperature
