# Description
- Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is an odd number and the employee name does not start with the character 'M'. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.
- Return the result table ordered by employee_id.
- The query result format is in the following example.

```

Example 1:

Input: 
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+--------+
| employee_id | name    | salary |
+-------------+---------+--------+
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3800   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7700   |
+-------------+---------+--------+
Output: 
+-------------+-------+
| employee_id | bonus |
+-------------+-------+
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |
+-------------+-------+
```

# SQL schema
```
Create table If Not Exists Employees (employee_id int, name varchar(30), salary int)
Truncate table Employees
insert into Employees (employee_id, name, salary) values ('2', 'Meir', '3000')
insert into Employees (employee_id, name, salary) values ('3', 'Michael', '3800')
insert into Employees (employee_id, name, salary) values ('7', 'Addilyn', '7400')
insert into Employees (employee_id, name, salary) values ('8', 'Juan', '6100')
insert into Employees (employee_id, name, salary) values ('9', 'Kannon', '7700')
```

# Solution #1
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT employee_id,
IF(employee_id%2!=0 AND name NOT LIKE 'M%', salary, 0) 
AS bonus 
FROM Employees
ORDER BY employee_id;

/*
SELECT employee_id, name AS n FROM Employees
WHERE employee_id%2!=0 AND name NOT LIKE 'M%' 
*/
```
