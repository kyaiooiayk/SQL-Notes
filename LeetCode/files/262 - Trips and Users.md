# Description
- The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of requests with unbanned users on that day.
- Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests with unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03". Round Cancellation Rate to two decimal points.
- Return the result table in any order.

Explanation: 
On 2013-10-01:
  - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
  - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
  - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
On 2013-10-02:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
On 2013-10-03:
  - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
  - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
  - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
  - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50
