## A note on the notebook rendering
Each notebook has two versions (all python scripts are unaffected by this):
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in black and white. These are placed in the folder named `GitHub_MD_rendering` where MD stands for MarkDown.
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in coloured.

## How to practice
- [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp) has some very nice tutorials where you can also try out your code in an interpreter running on their web browser. 
- [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) also allows you to try out some problem directly on your browser.
